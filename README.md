# JavaScript Basic Project di Brian Moretti

I'm a student of Start2Impact and this is my 2nd project made for them, the first one using JavaScript.

## About the project

The goal of this project is the build of a Counter, that shows 0 at the beginning, and 2 botton (+/-) used to change the counter value.

### - Build with

This project has been made only with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
No external libraries has been used neither other frameworks.

## Development Process

- Starting from scratch I coded some simple and not so nice HTML & CSS :sweat_smile:
- I focused all my attention to the JS code, cause it's the main part of the project.
- After creating all the variables, the functions and the events my focus shift to the style of the project.
- I decided to create a page that is also cool to see, so I spend some time to develop the style.
- As final step, I tested the counter to see if everything works as it should, cleaned and fixed a bit the CSS code.
